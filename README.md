## Notes
- The customer review section on the reference page is rendered dynamically via Shopify.
- In this submission, the review section was intentionally not implemented as a functional component.
- A static placeholder was used temporarily to separate adjacent sections during layout development.
- The focus of this test remains on UI accuracy, layout structure, and front-end execution as defined in the scope.
